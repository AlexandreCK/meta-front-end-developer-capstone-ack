## Introduction

This project serves as the capstone for the META Professional Front-End Certification, demonstrating the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. The challenge presented was to create a fully responsive and functional web application for the fictional Little Lemon restaurant. The application includes key features such as an intuitive reservation system, a dynamic menu, and a user-friendly interface, all designed using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to provide a seamless user experience that meets the needs of a modern restaurant business.

## Features

- **Functional Reservation System**: Users can easily reserve a table by filling out a form, with all inputs validated and confirmations provided.
- **Dynamic Menu Display**: The menu is dynamically displayed, allowing users to explore available dishes.
- **Interactive Carousel**: A carousel feature is included to highlight special offers, popular dishes, or key features of the restaurant.
- **Call to Action**: A prominent call-to-action button encourages users to explore the menu, enhancing user engagement.
- **Accessibility Features**: The application is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is usable by a wide range of users.
